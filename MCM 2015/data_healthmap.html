They prefer to use traditional healers, which may help the disease spread faster. Some believe that victims have been cursed by a "witch gun," and that only a witch doctor can remove the curse. Official healthcare workers have been denied access to the sick or refused blood samples. In one case, health workers were stoned by villagers who were trying to remove ebola patients from a healthcare center. "Given a health-care system lacking decent equipment, qualified staff and affordable drugs (rather than the more popular counterfeit ones), a lack of faith in Western medicine is understandable. The ministry of health has put out flyers with answers to questions such as “Is it true Ebola is a curse?” and “Can a mix of ginger, honey, garlic, onion and vinegar cure ebola?” At the same time, the authorities have used mobile-phone networks to warn people by text to avoid eating the meat of bats, one of the disease’s prime carriers. A band based in neighbouring Liberia, which also has the scourge, has released a catchy new song with lyrics such as “Ebola, ebola in town/Don’t touch your friend/No eating something/It’s dangerous”."</p>

<p>Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF/Doctors Without Borders) can no longer visit 20 villages in southern Guinea, where healthcare workers have faced too much hostility. “A worrying issue is that because of the lack of understanding of the disease there’s a real problem in communities in southern Guinea with growing hostility towards any foreigners. And this is really due to a lack of effort to explain well enough the reality of the disease,” said Bart Janssens, the MSF director of operations. Janssens stated that MSF, "which has sent 300 staff members and 40 tons of equipment, has reached the limits of what it can do."</p>

Their explanation cited Sierra Leone's poverty and lack of doctors, diagnostic tools, a disease-monitoring network, and protective clothing for healthcare workers as reasons why the country is struggling to contain the Ebola outbreak. Many cases are unreported because sick people may choose to self-treat or use traditional medicine rather than go to a hospital. In addition, diagnostic tests are expensive and diagnosis may stigmatize a patient.</p>

The 21-year-old left Guinea on Aug. 15, just days after his brother died of the disease, according to Guinea's Health Ministry. It said that the brother apparently caught Ebola in Sierra Leone. The student travelled by road, crossing into Senegal despite a border closure. He arrived in Dakar, the Senegalese capital, on Aug. 20, according to the World Health Organization, and was staying with relatives on the outskirts of the city. The agency said that on Aug. 23, he went to a medical facility seeking treatment for fever, diarrhea and vomiting -- all symptoms of Ebola but also many other diseases. But he concealed from doctors that he had had contact with infected people. He was treated instead for malaria and continued to stay with his relatives before turning up at a Dakar hospital on Aug. 26. Senegal's Health Ministry said Sunday that it has since traced everyone the student came into contact with, and they are being examined twice a day."</p>

<p>"Sierra Leone's deputy information minister, Theo Nichol, said on Saturday the three-day shutdown would make it easier for medical workers to trace suspected cases. Nichol said the period may be extended if needed. A presidency official had earlier said the lockdown would last for four days. But MSF said door-to-door screening required a high level of expertise and, even when cases were found, there were a lack of treatment centres and other facilities to take them to."</p>

The already impoverished west African state was on the slow road to recovery after 14 years of ruinous civil war ended in 2003, following the deaths of 250,000 people. But Information Minister Lewis Brown recently warned that the epidemic, which has left more than 1,800 dead so far this year, risks plunging Liberians back into conflict. Many observers of the country's latest devastating crisis, while stopping short of talk of war, worry about the heightened risk of unrest in a country stalked by death."</p>
<p>"Several police stations in Monrovia have closed after officers died of Ebola fever, and a military camp on the outskirts of Monrovia has reported around 30 sick soldiers, according to a diplomat."</p>
<p>"The health system – embryonic at best before the crisis, with some 50 doctors and 1,000 nurses for 4.3 million people – has been hit hard, losing 89 health workers out of 184 infected, according to the World Health Organization (WHO)."</p>
<p>"Schools have been closed for months with no reopening date in sight, and unemployment is soaring as both the formal and black-market economies collapse."</p>

They also say there are no other suspected cases of Ebola in the state. Experts say the man did not exhibit symptoms of the disease on the plane, which is good news. Ebola does not spread until an individual is sick with the virus. It’s not spread through the air, it’s spread through direct contact with a person who is infected with it. This is the first case of Ebola where someone traveled to the United States and became sick after arriving in this country. 'There is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here,' CDC Director Tom Frieden says."</p>

The authorities also said that an early opportunity to put the patient in isolation, limiting the risk of contagion, may have been missed because of a failure to pass along critical information about his travel history. The patient was identified by Liberian health officials and The Associated Press as Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national. Mr. Duncan came to the United States on Sept. 20 aboard a commercial airliner and officials said that he had shown no symptoms of the disease while on the flight and that he had posed no threat to other passengers. Mr. Duncan worked at a shipping company in Monrovia, Liberia, but had just quit his job, giving his resignation in early September, his boss said. He had gotten a visa to the United States and had decided to go, his neighbors said. He lived alone, but has family in the United States, they said. Mr. Duncan may have become infected after his landlord’s daughter fell gravely ill."</p>
<p>"Even as public officials sought to reassure the public that the situation was under control, there were questions about how the patient was treated when he first went to a hospital on Sept. 26. Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of the Texas Health Resources System, said the hospital staff had been instructed to ask patients about their travel history, following the advice of federal authorities. That checklist, he said, was utilized by a nurse and the patient volunteered that he had just come from Liberia. 'Regretfully that information was not fully communicated' to the full medical team, Dr. Lester said. As a result, that information was not used in the clinical diagnosis and Mr. Duncan was sent home, with the diagnostic team believing he simply had a low-grade fever from a viral infection. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance two days later, his condition having significantly deteriorated. He remains in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas in serious condition. In the time between Mr. Duncan’s trips to the hospital, health officials said he came into contact with more people while he was symptomatic and infectious."</p>

She expressed fear that the refusal of the people to be quarantined in accordance with Ministry of Health regulations could lead to the spread of the Ebola virus in the county."</p>
<p>"Kpedebah said the citizens are refusing to be quarantined on grounds that they need supplies such as mattresses, clothes and cooking utensils. Madam Kpedebah explained that the citizens said they will not honor the quarantine regulations if the county Ebola Task Force fails to supply them with the needed items.

More than 4,000 people have died from the Ebola virus, all but a handful of them in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to W.H.O. estimates issued last week. Dr. Chan declined to expand on those figures because they were still rising 'exponentially'."</p>

Aylward said the 70 percent death rate was 'a high mortality disease' in any circumstance and that the UN health agency was still focused on trying to get sick people isolated and provide treatment as early as possible. He told reporters that if the world's response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, 'a lot more people will die' and there will be a huge need to deal with the spiraling numbers of cases. For the last four weeks, there's been about 1,000 new cases per week — including suspected, confirmed and probable cases, he said, adding that the UN health agency is aiming to get 70 percent of cases isolated within two months to reverse the outbreak.

<p>"Data for epidemiological week 41 are incomplete, with missing data for 12 October from Liberia. This reflects the challenging nature of data gathering in countries with widespread and intense EVD transmission. These challenges remain particularly acute in Liberia, where there continues to be a mismatch between the relatively low numbers of new cases reported through official clinical surveillance systems on one hand, and reports from laboratory staff and first responders of large numbers of new cases on the other"</p>
<p>"It is clear, however, that the situation in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is deteriorating, with widespread and persistent transmission of EVD. An increase in new cases in Guinea is being driven by a spike in confirmed and suspected cases in the capital, Conakry, and the nearby district of Coyah."</p>
<p>Guinea: "There is evidence of an increase in the intensity of transmission in Guinea. Compared with the previous week, a very slight drop in the number of new confirmed cases reported from the capital Conakry (figure 1) has been more than offset by a sharp rise in the number of new cases in the neighbouring district of Coyah, with 25 cases reported between 6 and 12 October ... In the east of the country, on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, the districts of Beyla and Lola both reported new cases (figure 4), emphasizing the need for active surveillance at local border crossings. To the North, the district of Boke, on the border with Guinea-Bissau has reported active transmission for the first time in more than 21 days. The central district of Mamou has reported a confirmed case for the first time."</p>
<p>Liberia: "Data acquisition continues to be a challenge in Liberia. Evidence obtained from responders and laboratory staff in the country suggests that the situation in Liberia is getting worse, and that transmission remains intense in the capital, Monrovia ... Outside Monrovia, most newly reported cases have come from the districts of Bong (75 cases) and Margibi (28 cases)."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission is rampant in Sierra Leone, with 425 new confirmed cases reported between 6 and 12 October (figure 3). The areas hardest hit are the capital, Freetown, with 172 new cases, along with the neighbouring western districts of Bombali (94 cases) and Port Loko (67 cases)."</p>
<p>Health-Care Workers: As of 12th of October, 427 cases, 236 deaths.</p>
<p>"In Spain, 72 people, including 13 high-risk contacts, are being monitored. In the United States of America, 125 contacts are being monitored."</p>

<p>"According to Mr. Jallah, coordinated information reaching his office from the various Ebola Treatment Units, (ETUs), indicates that across the country, 'there are less than 400 people who are in treatment.' 'Therefore,' Jallah said, 'there are more than 300 ETUs that are empty, which means they are without people who are being treated for the virus.' The latest report has also made it clear that decisions and recommendations approved by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and implemented by the Liberian government have worked to reduce increased infection from the insidious disease, Mr. Jallah said. 'All of us should continue with the measures outlined in this fight,' he said, 'because the less than 400 people being treated in the various ETUs is still a high number,' he noted."</p>
<p>"With particular reference to the six hardest hit counties of Montserrado, Bomi, Bong, Lofa, Nimba and Margibi, Jallah said, 'Lofa County, particularly Foya and Barkedu, have registered less than ten persons in treatment in the last couple of weeks'."</p>

<p>Health-Care Workers: As of 19th of October, 443 cases, 244 deaths.</p>
<p>Guinea: "The outbreak in Guinea is being driven by transmission in four key areas. The 18 confirmed cases newly reported this week from the capital, Conakry, is the second highest weekly total since the outbreak began (figure 1). N'Zerekore (19 confirmed cases) and Kerouane (18 confirmed cases) have shown a sustained increase in new cases over the past two weeks. Both areas are near the border with Cote d'Ivoire to the east; to the west they border the district of Macenta, where transmission has been intense for the past 10 weeks (38 new confirmed cases reported during the past week)."</p>

<p>Liberia: "The 444 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases reported from Liberia this week is the highest number in the past four weeks and the fourth highest since the outbreak began (figure 2). Liberia remains the country worst affected by the outbreak.

<p>Liberia: "Only 15 of the 444 new cases reported nationwide from Liberia this week are confirmed cases. This is due to a
continuing failure to integrate laboratory results into clinical epidemiology reports."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission remains intense in Sierra Leone, with 325 new confirmed cases reported during the past week (figure 3). The capital, Freetown, reported 138 new confirmed cases, and remains the area of most intense transmission, followed by the neighbouring western districts of Bombali (53 confirmed cases) and Port Loko (39 confirmed cases)."</p>
<p>United States: "Of 172 possible contacts, 60 have completed 21-day follow-up. A total of 112 contacts are currently being monitored in Texas.

<p>United States: "There have now been four cases and one death (table 2) in the United States of America. The most recent case is a medical aid worker who volunteered in Guinea and returned to New York City on 17 October. The patient was
screened and was asymptomatic on arrival, but reported a fever on 23 October, and tested positive for EVD. The
patient is currently in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, one of eight New York State hospitals that
have been designated to treat patients with EVD. Possible contacts are being identified and followed up."</p>
<p>Mali: "On 23 October, Mali reported its first confirmed case of EVD (table 2). The patient was a 2-year old girl who travelled from the Guinean district of Kissidougou with her grandmother to the city of Kayes in western Mali, which is approximately 600 km from the Malian capital Bamako and lies close to the border with Senegal. The patient was symptomatic for much of the journey. On 22 October the patient was taken to Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes, where she died on on 24 October. At present, 43 contacts, of whom 10 are HCWs, are being monitored; efforts to trace further contacts are ongoing.

<p>"The WHO said that an investigation into the girl’s case showed that she had already started showing symptoms before being taken to Kayes, making her contagious and raising the risk of more people being infected. 'The WHO is treating the situation in Mali as an emergency. The child’s symptomatic state during the bus journey is especially concerning, as it presented multiple opportunities for exposures -- including high-risk exposures -- involving many people,' the WHO said in a statement Friday, adding: 'Key staff from WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were already in Mali assisting with the country’s preparedness measures, should an imported case occur.'"</p>

Keita said that the incident showed it was impossible to completely seal his country off from Ebola in neighbouring Guinea but said he remained calm as the girl's journey and potential contacts had already been traced. "Guinea is Mali's neighbour. We have a shared border that we did not close and we will not close," he told France's RFI radio station.

They have taken to chanting "no pay, no work" during their protests. The Awareness Times also reports that the number is significantly lower than the total number of health workers who have not received pay. The government confirmed that workers in "over 800 communities" have not received weekly salaries for more than a month. The article ends ominously: "Meanwhile a team of police personnel arrived at the Kenema Government Hospital to quell down the situation as it was gradually becoming riotous."

<p>"All districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been affected."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission remains very concerning in Sierra Leone, with the country reporting 435 confirmed cases in the past week. Much of this was driven by intense transmission in the capital of Freetown, which reported 115 new confirmed cases and remains one of the worst affected cities in this outbreak (figure 3). The western districts of Bombali (90 confirmed cases) and Port Loko (64 confirmed cases) and the western rural area of the country (75 confirmed cases) remain key drivers of the rise in incidence in the country."</p>
<p>Guinea: "While the incidence of EVD appears to be stable at a national level, EVD transmission in Guinea remains intense.
There were 93 new confirmed cases reported in the past week, and more than half of those cases were reported in Macenta, in the south-west of Guinea near the Liberian border. The district reported 50 confirmed cases in the past week, and remains the most seriously affected area in Guinea. There are, however, signs that the incidence could be flattening in some areas. The outbreak’s epicentre of Gueckedou did not report a single confirmed case in the past week."</p>
<p>Liberia: "There appears to be some evidence of a decline at the national level in Liberia, although new case numbers remain high in parts of the country. While Liberia did not report any confirmed cases in its situation reports in the past week, it reported 89 probable cases. The Montserrado area, which includes the capital of Monrovia, accounted for 50 probable cases in the past week (figure 2). This continuing intensity of transmission emphasizes the need to continue efforts to contain the spread of disease in the capital."</p>

<p>Health-Care Workers: "WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine how each HCW became infected.

<p>"The EVD outbreak has likely killed far more people than the 4,828 deaths reported by the World Health Organization, WHO's strategy chief Christopher Dye said Thursday, warning that thousands of fatalities were likely not accounted for. The likely explanation is that many people are burying the dead in secret, possibly to avoid having authorities interfere with burial customs like washing and touching the deceased, which is widely blamed for much of the transmission. The fact that WHO-reported numbers of cases and deaths are lower now than they were last week is due to a different, more consistent manner of counting, Mr. Dye said. It does not imply a slowing down of the disease."</p>
<p>"Sierra Leone's Deputy Health Minister Madina Radman said the country's failure to clearly separate its EVD treatment units from regular health facilities had destroyed confidence in hospitals and clinics. 'We are struggling to regain confidence in our health facilities because of this mistake', she said. 'About 50 per cent of the deaths in the country are not Ebola but, because people fear to come to some of our healthcare facilities, they die needlessly due to other treatable diseases.'"</p>
<p>"According to analysis by the NGO Action Contre la Faim and the University of Naples Federico II, in 2015 the EVD crisis will lead to an increase of people suffering from undernourishment in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 5,3 to 5,7 million people are expected be undernourished in 2015 in the 3 most affected countries, compared to 5 million before the start of the epidemic."</p>

They arise from independent chains of transmission involving different villages and different families across the border in Guinea. Background about the new case: the transmission chain starts in Guinea According to the preliminary investigation, a 70-year-old male resident of Kourémalé village, in the Siguiri prefecture of Guinea, had onset of symptoms from an undiagnosed disease on 17 October. On 18 October, he was admitted to a private clinic in the mining town of Siguiri. The town, which is located along Guinea's 800 km border with Mali, was an intense focus of Ebola virus transmission from early July to mid-August. As his condition did not improve, he was transferred to another clinic located just across the border in Mali. On 25 October, he travelled by car, together with 4 family members to seek treatment at the Pasteur Clinic in Bamako. He was suffering from acute kidney failure, a complication often seen in late-stage Ebola virus disease. Multiple laboratory tests were performed, but not for Ebola. He was treated at the Pasteur Clinic from 25 October until his death, from kidney failure, on 27 October. In addition, a friend who visited him at the clinic also died abruptly from an undiagnosed disease. Both are considered probable Ebola cases. For both, no samples are available for testing. The nurse, whose fatal Ebola infection was confirmed on 11 November, worked at the Pasteur Clinic. Because of his religious status as a Grand Imam, his body was transported to a mosque in Bamako for a ritual washing ceremony. The body was then returned to the native village of Kourémalé for formal funeral and burial ceremonies. Although these events are still under investigation, WHO staff assume that many mourners attended the ceremonies. A devastated family In that same village, the deceased patient's first wife died of an undiagnosed disease on 6 November. His brother and his second wife are currently being managed at an Ebola treatment centre in Gueckedou, Guinea. All 3 accompanied the patient during the car trip to Bamako. On 10 November, his daughter died from an undiagnosed disease. The family declined offers of a safe burial. On 11 November, the man's son, who is currently at the Ebola treatment center in Gueckedou, tested positive for Ebola at the European Union's mobile biosafety level 3 laboratory there. He was the fourth family member in the car trip to Bamako. Confirmation of his infection further increases the likelihood that deaths in other family members were caused by Ebola. Emergency measures under way Intensive contact tracing is under way in both countries, with support from WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MSF, and other international partners."</p>

The decision effectively ends the state of emergency that officially expired earlier this month, though Sirleaf said a night curfew remains in force. The emergency had allowed authorities to restrict movement in areas hard hit by the virus. Ebola has hit Liberia harder than Guinea or Sierra Leone, the two other countries at the center of the worst outbreak of the disease on record. 'The progress we have witnessed coupled with the various measures and ongoing interventions ... have combined to re-position our country to sustain the fight against the virus until it is finally eradicated from our country,' Sirleaf said.

The case has dashed hopes that while Ebola continues to spread fast in the western area encompassing the capital Freetown, the eastern region where the crisis first emerged had beaten the virus. 'After zero cases reported for the past 26 days, the eastern town had an Ebola death involving a woman who had visited the city 10 days ago and started feeling sick,' health ministry spokesman Abass Kamara told AFP. 'She was treated at the Kenema government hospital but her Ebola status was not detected and she later died. When a swab was taken, it was found out that she was Ebola positive.' The spread of the virulent tropical pathogen appears to be slowing in neighbouring Liberia, which has set itself the goal of eradicating the virus by the end of the year. But transmission remains "intense" in Sierra Leone, according to the World Health Organization, with more than 1,200 lives lost since the first cases in the east. Kamara said 11 nurses who treated the new case had been placed in quarantine. 'We thought we were well on the path of getting out of the woods as far as Ebola is concerned but the news is shattering,' Kenema resident Marian Kaikai told AFP."</p>

<p>"More than 1,200 people have died of Ebola in Guinea alone. However, Dr Rodier said that the situation in Guinea was now 'relatively stable'. 'When you look in more detail, you see that it's still quite active in the Guinea forest area [in] the south of the country,' Dr Rodier said. However, he added that the situation was 'actually improving in a number of prefectures, especially Conakry', where there was a fairly good understanding of how the disease was spreading. The WHO has faced criticism that it was too slow to respond during the start of the crisis. However, Dr Rodier said it was the first time there had been such a serious outbreak in West Africa, adding: 'Lessons have been learned.' Refused entry Guinea has not been as badly hit by Ebola as neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia."</p>

Ebola Emergency Response Mission will not fully meet its Dec. 1 target for containing the virus due to escalating numbers of cases in Sierra Leone, Anthony Banbury, the head of UNMEER, said on Monday. The mission set the goal in September of having 70 percent of Ebola patients under treatment and 70 percent of victims safely buried. That target will be achieved in some areas, Banbury told Reuters, citing progress in Liberia. 'We are going to exceed the Dec 1 targets in some areas. But we are almost certainly going to fall short in others. In both those cases, we will adjust to what the circumstances are on the ground,' he said in an interview. The death toll in the worst Ebola epidemic on record has risen to 5,459 out of 15,351 cases identified in eight countries by Nov. 18, the World Health Organization said on Friday. Almost all those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Banbury said the areas of greatest concern are in rural parts of Sierra Leone as well as the city of Makeni in the centre of the country and Port Loko in the northwest and the capital Freetown."</p>

A gang of robbers held up a taxi last week near the town of Kissidougou which was transporting the sample from central Kankan prefecture to southern Gueckedou, around 265 kilometres (165 miles) away. 'We are confident of not being able to find this cooler. With the media attention around the case, we are confident that the bandits would have got rid of it,' said Fode Tass Sylla, spokesman for the government's Ebola response unit. Tass said the virus would not have survived in the sample, although studies have shown that it can last in fluids for several weeks if it is not kept in direct sunlight. Guinea authorities have appealed to the robbers to return the sample, taken from a patient`s mouth shortly after they died. The incident has spread alarm over the safety of transporting samples of the highly virulent pathogen, which is estimated to kill around 70 percent of those it infects."</p>

With the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun already under quarantine, more than half of the population of six million -- in six of the nation's 14 districts -- now finds itself unable to move freely. Tonkolili, a district of around 400,000 people some 350 kilometres (220 miles) from the capital Freetown, is expected to end its quarantine on December 15, according to health ministry officials."</p>

The past week has also seen a spike in cases in Tonkolili and Kono. In an effort to contain the outbreak, Tonkolili in the centre of the country, has become the sixth district to enforce quarantine. Unlike Tonkolili which is expected to end its quarantine on 15 December 2014, Bombali, Kailahun, Kenema, Moyamba and Port Loko remain under indefinite quarantine. Due the quarantine, almost 2.9 million people cannot leave or enter a district without a special pass issued by the government. The quarantines have increased tensions among the population and security personnel working at the checkpoints. Unsafe burials, including the washing of dead bodies, late reporting and lack of isolation continue to be the major factors in the high rates of transmission across the country, especially in Freetown and in rural areas in the hotspot districts. The capital, Freetown, remains the worst affected."</p>
<p>"The government estimates that around 22 percent of cases are children (0-17 years). To date, the UNICEF-led Family Tracing and Reunification (FTR) network has identified 9,524 children as being directly affected by the Ebola crisis (4,826 girls and 4,698 boys), including 4,349 children having lost one or both parents to EVD.

'The increase in transmission in western Sierra Leone is a reflection of the fact that communities there have yet to fully embrace the outbreak and to take action to avoid infection themselves,' he added. The second 'troublesome' area is the northern part of Guinea's interior, a region known as Guinea Forestiere, he said.

treatment in the north, and in neighbouring Mali in particular, rather than at existing facilities in the southeastern districts of Gueckedou (2 new confirmed cases in the week to 7 December) and Macenta."</p>
<p>Liberia: "Case incidence has decreased over the past 4 weeks, with 5 districts (counties) reporting new cases in the 3 days to 3 December. A total of 29 confirmed cases were reported in the 3 days to 3 December. The district of Montserrado, which includes the capital, Monrovia (figure 2), reported 15 confirmed cases, and accounted for more than half of all confirmed cases nationally over the reporting period."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission remains intense in Sierra Leone, with 397 new confirmed cases reported in the week to 7
December (3 times as many as Guinea and Liberia combined). The worst affected area remains the capital, Freetown, which reported one-third (133) of all new confirmed cases (figure 3). Transmission remains persistent and intense across the country with the exception of the south, with the districts of Bo (14 cases), Bombali (57 cases), Kambia (10 cases), Kono (24 cases), Koinadugu (2 cases), Moyamba (10 cases), Port Loko (76 cases), Tonkolili (13 cases), and Western Rural Area (57 cases) all reporting high numbers of new confirmed cases."</p>

<p>Guinea: "A total of 76 new confirmed cases were reported nationally during the week to 14 December (figure 1). The
national trend in Guinea has been fluctuating since September, with between 75 and 148 confirmed cases
reported each week. There is no clear upward or downward trend in national case incidence."</p>
<p>Liberia: "Case incidence has been declining at a national level, with 6 districts reporting new confirmed or probable cases in
the week to 14 December. A total of 8 confirmed cases were reported, but this case count accounts for only two
days."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "EVD transmission remains intense in Sierra Leone, with 327 new confirmed cases reported in the week to 14
December. While there are signs from the country situation reports that the increase in incidence has slowed and
the incidence may no longer be increasing (figure 3), the country reported the highest number of confirmed cases
in epidemiological week 50. Transmission is most intense and persistent in the western and northern districts of
the country. The capital, Freetown, accounted for 125 of all new confirmed cases. Other western districts
reporting new confirmed cases include Port Loko (56), Western Rural Area (52), Bombali (23) and Kambia (11).
WHO, UN partners and the Government of Sierra Leone have implemented the Western Area Surge, an operation
to intensify efforts to curb the disease in the western parts of the country. The response targets Freetown and
neighbouring areas to break chains of transmission, and increase the number of beds to ensure patients with
clinical symptoms of EVD are isolated and receive appropriate treatment."</p>
<p>Case Fatality: "The cumulative case fatality rate in the three intense-transmission countries among all probable and confirmed cases for whom a definitive outcome is recorded is 70%. For those patients recorded as hospitalized, the case
fatality rate is 60% in each of Guinea and Sierra Leone and 58% in Liberia (tables 3–5)."</p>

Africa trip - Washington Post<i class="icon-circle-arrow-right"></i></a></p><p>CDC Director, Tom Frieden, reports on week-long trip to countries hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic:</p>
<p>"Liberia 'has the upper hand against the virus,' he said. But in parts of Monrovia, disease detectives are having trouble tracking down cases because some patients are heading to Ebola treatment units hours outside the city. One family, believing that treatment outside the capital was safer, took a six-hour taxi ride to an ETU, potentially exposing the taxi driver and others, he said."</p>
<p>"In Sierra Leone, the challenges 'remain very extensive,' with at least 10 confirmed deaths a day from Ebola, he said. Fear of Ebola has also scared pregnant women and others with malaria and pneumonia from seeking treatment at hospitals. But Frieden said that if the global response remains strong, Freetown and the western parts of the country 'should see a significant decrease in cases' within the next few weeks."</p>
<p>"In Guinea, Frieden traveled to the remote area that was the epicenter of the outbreak a year ago and was encouraged to see an Ebola treatment unit and a decrease in the caseload. But in the capital of Conakry, 'one of the scariest things I heard' came from a Doctors Without Borders team leader, who told Frieden that for the first time since the outbreak, they recently had more patients than isolation beds."</p>

Officials said two experienced technicians made mistakes at the high-security lab, known as Biosafety level-4 lab (BSL-4), when material from an Ebola virus experiment was securely transported from the BSL-4 lab to a BSL-2. The material may have contained a live sample of the virus, a sample that should have remained in BSL-4 and stored in a freezer. The second mistake came when a BSL-2 lab technician should have recognized, via the color coding on the test tubes, the material was restricted to Level 4. That second technician is the person who could have been exposed and is now in the 21-day monitoring period, agency spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said.

Published in EMBO Molecular Medicine, experts have said the most likely culprit for the Ebola outbreak, which has currently led to 7,842 deaths, are free-tailed bats – not fruit bats as had previously been believed. Transmission occurs from bites and scratches, and contact with bodily fluids, tissue, and excrement. On 26 December 2013, Ebola was identified in Emile Ouamouno, a toddler from the remote Guinean village of Meliandou."</p>
<p>"Officials believed the virus was transmitted to humans from hunting and eating bats – this practice can lead to infection of 'zoonotic' pathogens, with bats known for hosting more viruses than any other mammal. Scientists at the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin, Germany, say the hunting and eating of fruit bats is not likely to be the cause of the current virus outbreak because this would have caused widespread transmission either concurrently with or before the death of Ouamouno. Findings of the study showed that while exposure to fruit bats through hunting and consumption in Meliandou is common, this may not be the cause of the Ebola outbreak. '[F]ruit bats seem an unlikely source of infection, as a food-borne transmission would have affected adults before or concurrently with the two-year-old boy [Emile Ouamouno] - the index case. This suggests a source of infection unrelated to food,' the study authors said. Villagers reported that children had been playing in and around a hollow tree near the home of the index victim. The tree was home to a large colony of free-tailed insectivorous bats, meaning the potential for 'massive exposure' to the creatures for the children. 'Though no one knew it at the time, the Ebola virus had found a new home in a highly vulnerable population,' WHO said."</p>

She was flown to London for treatment on a Royal Air Force Hercules and has been in a state-of-the-art isolation unit and surrounded by medical staff 24 hours a day. On New Year's Eve, Dr. Michael Jacobs, an infectious disease specialist who is part of the team treating Cafferkey, said she was sitting up in bed, talking and reading and had been able to speak to her family through protective screens. She was being treated with an experimental antiviral drug and given blood plasma from one of Europe's Ebola survivors.

The move comes as the government imposed 'additional screening measures' at Freetown International Airport after two workers apparently caught the disease. A five-day lockdown had been declared by the government across the badly hit north of the country last month. More than 70 cases of the virus had been confirmed in Tonkolili during a five-week lockdown there ordered by local authorities, District Coordinator Salieu Bah told journalists. 'The lockdown is extended for another two weeks to intensify monitoring efforts by all sectors in the district as we need this mopping up operation until Jan. 17,' he added. He said people had been 'reluctant to comply with health rules such as late reporting of suspected Ebola cases and undertaking secret burials.' Meanwhile, Health Minister Dr. Abubakarr Fofanah said screening of workers at the airport in Freetown will now be done 'on a 24-hour basis to detect any suspicion of Ebola on a worker or traveler.' The National Ebola Response Centre (NERC) said 'a case of Ebola was detected and confirmed by laboratory test on Friday involving a person who worked at the airport up to mid-December but had not worked since that time.' Another airport employee who had been in contact with the person has not come to work since Christmas Day. 'Due to these developments, additional measures have been put in place to enhance robust screening,' NERC said in a statement."</p>

At the new burial ground at Disco Hill, Christians and Muslims are now buried according to the religious traditions in separate blocks of the graveyard.

He said congratulations are likely in order for parts of the south, including Pujehun district."</p>
<p>"“The reason being,” he explained, “is they have not been recording any case of confirmed Ebola for the past 41 days. So, tomorrow if the trend continues and if we go by what World Health Organization is saying, then Pujehun should be declared Ebola-free.” He said the government has also decided to extend by two weeks a program to contain the virus in the western part of the country."</p>

Yeiah said the dead body was dressed in ordinary clothing like a regular passenger and strapped with seat belt in the front seat of the taxi, which evaded the checkpoints to smuggle the body into the county. He said the County Health Team (CHT) through its partners received a tip-off but before they could reach the town the next morning, the people had already carried out an overnight wake-keeping and early burial. He said since Lonfay Town was quarantined for 23 days, there has been no new case arising from the town, and although there have been two deaths in two nearby towns, the victims tested negative for the virus. Dr. Yeiah said following the isolation of Lonfay Town, there are plans to lift the quarantine on the town as it continues to have no new case of the virus following the incident. He said consultations are ongoing with partners to ensure that the quarantine on Lonfay Town is relaxed on or before January 30, 2015."</p>

Since the worst outbreak on record began in West Africa over a year ago, Sierra Leone has recorded more than 10,340 cases, making it the country that has been hardest hit. But signs are growing that the tide is turning against the disease. 'We are now entering a transition phase. Given the progress being made against the disease, we must take action to enable economic and social recovery,' Koroma said in a televised address to the nation late on Thursday. Quarantine measures were previously in place in six of 14 districts in the poor nation of farmers, fishermen and diamond miners. Koroma, who aims to get to zero cases in the former British colony by the end of March, said that restrictions on trading hours in Freetown would also be eased. Individual households with known Ebola contacts will remain under quarantine. 'Though victory is in sight, we must not relent, we must continue to soldier on,' Koroma said, urging people to refrain from touching the sick and the dead. Ebola spreads via contact with bodily fluids of infected people such as blood and vomit. In the latest health report on Jan. 21, Sierra Leone reported just 9 new confirmed cases versus 60 cases daily in late 2014."</p>

<p>"The response to the EVD epidemic has now moved to a second phase, as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. To achieve this goal as quickly as possible, efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding, case management, safe burials, and community engagement is used as effectively as possible. For the first time since the week ending 29 June 2014, there have been fewer than 100 new confirmed cases reported in a week in the 3 most-affected countries. A combined total of 99 confirmed cases were reported from the 3 countries in the week to 25 January: 30 in Guinea, 4 in Liberia, and 65 in Sierra Leone."</p>
<p>Guinea: "A total of 30 confirmed cases were reported in the 7 days to 25 January 2015 (figure 2), compared with 20 the week before. This is the first time this year that case incidence has increased in Guinea from week-to-week. Eight districts reported a confirmed or probable case during the reporting period (figure 2). The northern district of Mali, which borders Senegal, reported its first confirmed case (figure 1); a man who travelled from Liberia. Senegal has recently reopened border crossings with Guinea; surveillance in districts that border affected countries is being implemented."</p>
<p>Liberia: "Case incidence has declined from a peak of over 300 new confirmed cases per week in August and September 2014 to 4 confirmed cases in the 7 days to 25 January 2015 (figure 3), compared with 8 cases the previous week. All 4 confirmed cases were reported from Montserrado, the district that includes the capital, Monrovia (figure 1 and figure 3). The adjacent district of Bomi reported 3 probable cases."</p>
<p>Sierra Leone: "Case incidence continues to decline rapidly in Sierra Leone. There were 65 new confirmed cases reported in the week to 25 January 2015, compared with 117 the previous week and 184 the week before that. The west of the country remains the area of most intense transmission. The capital, Freetown, reported 20 new confirmed cases, compared with 30 the previous week. The nearby districts of Kambia and Western Rural reported 10 and 16 new confirmed cases, respectively, in the 7 days to 25 January (figure 1, figure 4)."</p>
<p>United Kingdom: "In the United Kingdom, public health authorities confirmed a case of EVD in Glasgow, Scotland, on 29 December 2014 (table 5). The case was a health worker who returned from volunteering at an ETC in Sierra Leone. The patient was isolated on 29 December and received treatment in London. On 23 January the patient tested negative twice for EVD, and on 24 January the patient was discharged. All contacts have completed 21-day follow-up."</p>
